#summary abstraction about function of mbuf
#labels mbuf,function

= methods =
 * allocatePacket
   allocate packet with *data* sepecified length.
   packet is the whole of chains.
 * mbuf_pkthdr_len
   return length of packet( data of the whole chaines)
 * mbuf_pkthdr_setlen
   set length of packet (data of the whole chaines).
   if use this function, should chage other mbuf_len of same chains?
 * mbuf_len 
   data size of signle mbuf  
 * mbuf_leadingspace
   area length before current pointer.( only single mbuf).
 * mbuf_trailingspace
   free area length following current data. (only single mbuf).
