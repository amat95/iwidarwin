= F.A.Q =
==When will the 3945 or 2100 be supported?==

We do not have this card in house. We can write test code, but no release is currently working. We are looking for skilled developers with a 2100 or 3945abg card to help.

==When will configuration via the Airport menu be supported?==

We may never be able to use the Airport utility. Its hard to say because we must analyze the IO80211Family which is closed source and not well documented. Use NetworkSelector instead. 

==How do I install or upgrade my driver?==
Please refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/iwidarwin/wiki/Installation installation guide.] Upgrades follow the same procedure as a new installation. 

==Why is my card detected as an Ethernet adapter instead of an Airport card?==

This is normal and to be expected. We wrote the driver this way because the IO80211Family is closed source and not well documented. There is more information available for "wired" adapters in Mac OS. The basic networking functions of your card will be handled by the OS and wireless features are supplemented with our "NetworkSelector" utility.

==What is NetworkSelector?==

NetworkSelector is used to configured the wireless card. Read more [http://code.google.com/p/iwidarwin/wiki/NetworkSelector here]

==When will WEP or 802.1x be supported?==

Because of the closed source nature of OSX86 it will be hard to make progress in this area. It may be possible in the future with an improved driver and networkselector application but currently only unencrypted networks are supported

==What driver do I use for my 2915abg?==

Please install the iwi2200 driver. 

==Why is my 2915abg is unable to connect to my unencrypted 802.11a network?==

We are aware of this issue. Please use 802.11b in the meantime.

==Do i need to update my version of OSX to 10.4.8+ to use this driver?==
Nope, the iwi driver requires Apple80211.framework and IO80211.kext from 10.4.7


==How do I create log's to help development of the drivers?==
  # go to Terminal.App
  {{{
  % sudo -s
  % cd ~/Desktop
  % dmesg > dmesg.txt
  % cat /var/log/system.log > system.txt
  % ioreg -w 0 > ioreg.txt
  }}}
  # Now you have 3 log files; dmesg.txt, system.txt and ioreg.txt you can find them on the desktop


==How can I uninstall the driver?==
First you must determine which driver is installed, either iwi2100, iwi3945 or iwi2200.
  # go to Terminal.App
  {{{
  % sudo -s
  % rm /System/Library/Extensions/iwiXXXX.kext (replace XXXX with your specific driver)
  % rm /System/Library/Extensions.*
  % kextcache -k /System/Library/Extensions
  }}}
  # Driver is now uninstalled
