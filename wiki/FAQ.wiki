= F.A.Q =
==When will the 3945 or 2100 be supported?==

We do not have this card in house. We can write test code, but no release is currently working. We are looking for skilled developers with a 2100 or 3945abg card to help.

==When will configuration via the Airport menu be supported?==

We may never be able to use the Airport utility. Its hard to say because we must analyze the IO80211Family which is closed source and not well documented. Use our utlity "NetworkSelector" instead 

==How do I install or upgrade my driver?==
Look to the project homepage at http://code.google.com/p/iwidarwin/ to get the lastest driver. The included package should install or update your driver automatically. Make sure to use the matching version of network selector as they are not compatible between different driver versions. Once the driver package is finished reboot your system. After the reboot open "Network Preferences" and the adapter will be listed.

==Why is my card detected as a PCI Ethernet adapter instead of an airport card?==

This is normal and to be expected. We wrote the driver this way because the IO80211Family is closed source and not well documented. There is more information available for "wired" adapters in Mac OS. The basic networking functions of your card will be handled by the OS and wireless features are supplimented with our "NetworkSelector" utility.

==What does NetworkSelector do and why do I need it?==
This application also allows you to control power to your card if you do not have an external switch. It will display any unencrypted networks in the area and allow you to associate with them. You can change the state of the wireless LED (if equiped). 

==When will WEP or 802.1x be supported?==

Because of the closed source nature of OSX86 it will be hard to make progess in this area. It may be possible in the future with an improved driver and networkselector application but currently only unencrypted networks are supported

==Why is my 2915abg is unable to connect to my unencrypted 802.11a network?==
We are working on this issue. Stay tuned.

==Do i need to update my version of OSX to 10.4.8+ to use this driver?==
Nope, the iwi driver requires Apple80211.framework and IO80211.kext from 10.4.7


==How do I create log's to help development of the drivers?==
  # go to Terminal.App
  {{{
  % sudo -s
  % cd ~/Desktop
  % dmesg > dmesg.txt
  % cat /var/log/system.log > system.txt
  % ioreg -w 0 > ioreg.txt
  }}}
  # Now you have 3 log files; dmesg.txt, system.txt and ioreg.txt you can find them on the desktop


==How can I uninstall iwi3945?==
  # go to Terminal.App
  {{{
  % sudo -s
  % rm /System/Library/Extensions/iwi3945.kext
  % rm /System/Library/Extensions.*
  % kextcache -k /System/Library/Extensions
  }}}
  # iwi3945 is now uninstalled
