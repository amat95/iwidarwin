==========================

The following provides a brief description of currently known issues or 
problems encountered by users. If a defect # is provided, you can find 
additional or updated information by visiting http://bughost.org and 
entering the defect number as indicated.


As noted below, Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection driver does not
support all ethtool options
------------------------------------

Currently Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection driver supports
'ethtool -i' option. It does not support other options such as -g, -S, -d,
and -e.

Defect #292


Does not support bit rate in IBSS mode
------------------------------------

In IBSS mode Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection driver does not
support bit rate. After two laptops have been associated, the
Bit Rate = 0 kb/s by 'iwconfig' and 'iwlist <interface> bitrate'. 

Defect #307


Firmware restart is detected randomly
----------------------------------

After running one or two days, Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection
driver will only occasionally restart the firmware.
"ipw2100: Fatal interrupt. Scheduling firmware restart"

To resolve this problem, the system must be rebooted.

Defect #329


Power management does not turn to AUTO when setting power level 0
-----------------------------------------------------------

'iwpriv <interface> set_power 0' will not set power level to AUTO and will not
enable power management if power management was not previously enabled.

Workaround: power management will turn to AUTO after previously enabled such as
'iwpriv eth1 set_power 1' and then 'iwpriv eth1 set_power 0'.

Defect #335


iwconfig txpower -dBm
--------------------

To set -dBm, don't postfix 'dBm'

Defect #339


Channels 12, 13, and 14 are not supported in monitor mode
-------------------------------------------------

Currently the driver does not support channel 12, 13 and 14 in monitor mode.
It does support channels 1~11.

Defect #437


No packets! - RF kill switch
---------------------------     

If the module loads, but no packets are transferred, you may have a
software-based radio kill switch.  All laptops have some capability to
disable the radio via a button or switch.  On some laptops that switch
is physically tied to Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection driver;
simply toggling the switch should enable the radio.

On other laptops, the switch is a button that when pressed requires the 
software driver to send hardware commands to another piece of hardware on
the laptop which controls the radio.

To know if the radio is being disabled via the RF switch, perform the following:

% cat /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2100/*/rf_kill<br>

The reported values mean:

  0 = RF kill not enabled (radio on)
  1 = SW based RF kill active (radio off)
  2 = HW based RF kill active (radio off)
  3 = Both HW and SW RF kill active (radio off)


The Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network Connection driver cannot control
the state of the hardware-based RF switches.
